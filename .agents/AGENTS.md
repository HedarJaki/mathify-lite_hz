# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) working in this repository.
This is the canonical rules file — `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root just imports it, so
edit this file, not that one.

## General Guidelines
These are common instructions across all scenarios.
- Never use the em dash "—". Use plain dash "-" instead.
- When writing commit messages, NEVER auto-add your agent name as co-author.
- Never manually modify any files that are marked as auto-generated.
- When writing or substantially editing long Markdown files, put each full sentence on its own line.
- Preserve normal Markdown structure, but avoid wrapping multiple sentences onto one physical line.
- When making technical decisions, do not give much weight to development cost.
- Instead, prefer quality, simplicity, robustness, scalability, and long term maintainability.
- When doing bug fixes, always start with reproducing the bug in an E2E setting as closely aligned with how an end user experiences it.
- This makes sure you find the real problem so your fix will actually solve it.
- When end-to-end testing a product, be picky about the UI you see and be obsessed with pixel perfection.
- If something clearly looks off, even if it is not directly related to what you are doing, try to get it fixed along the way.
- Apply that same high standard to engineering excellence: lint, test failures, and test flakiness.
- If you see one, even if it is not caused by what you are working on right now, still get it fixed.

## Project

**Mathify Lite** — a Java servlet web application for a gamified math learning
platform (courses, modules, quizzes, achievements, streaks, premium plans).
It is built as a WAR and runs on Tomcat 10.1 (Jakarta Servlet 6.0).

Tech stack and data-layer details live in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
(Stack / Data layer sections) — not repeated here to avoid drift.

## Build & run

```bash
mvn package cargo:run     # build the WAR and launch embedded Tomcat 10.1
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080/** (the app is deployed at context path `/`).
Cargo downloads Tomcat automatically on first run into `target/`.

```bash
mvn compile               # compile Java only
mvn package               # build target/mathify-lite.war
```

  dao/      UserDAO, CourseDAO, ProgressDAO — data access (PreparedStatements, returns models)
  model/    36 domain classes — User/Student/Admin, Course/Chapter/Topic,
                                quizzes & questions, progress, achievements…
  util/     AuthUtil, NavigationUtil  — session/auth helpers; NavigationUtil.redirectWithLoading()
                                        for forward navigation (see below)

            servlet/filter/   StudentAuthFilter, AdminAuthFilter
src/main/webapp/
  WEB-INF/web.xml             — only LoginServlet/RegisterServlet + welcome files;
                                everything else under servlet/ uses @WebServlet/@WebFilter
  index.jsp                   — entry; redirects to student/dashboard.jsp
  login.jsp, register.jsp     — auth pages (POST to /login, /register)
  loading.jsp                 — interstitial screen used by NavigationUtil.redirectWithLoading()
  student/*.jsp               — dashboard, catalog, course, module, quiz,
                                achievements, premium
  admin/*.jsp                 — dashboard, courses, editor, quiz-editor, students
  assets/css/app.css          — shared styles
  assets/js/app.js            — injects the shared navbar/header into every page
src/main/resources/db.properties
database/mathify_schema.sql    — MySQL schema
```

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Views are JSP, not HTML.** All pages use the `.jsp` extension and start with
  `<%@ page contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8" %>`.
  When adding a page or linking between pages, always reference `.jsp`.
- The current JSPs are essentially static markup (no scriptlets/EL). If you add
  dynamic JSP, beware that literal `<%` and `${...}` in inline `<script>`/`<style>`
  are interpreted by the JSP engine — escape them (`<\%`, `\${`) or use
  `<%@ page isELIgnored="true" %>` where appropriate.
- Navigation chrome is **not** in the page markup — `assets/js/app.js` builds the
  navbar at runtime from `data-role` / `data-page` / `data-base` attributes on
  `<body>`. Update `app.js` when adding nav destinations, not each page.
- Use the **Jakarta** namespace (`jakarta.servlet.*`). Never `javax.servlet.*`.
- **Avoid duplicate servlet mappings:** most servlets/filters use `@WebServlet`/
  `@WebFilter` annotations, not `web.xml`. Only `LoginServlet` and
  `RegisterServlet` are registered in `web.xml` (legacy). Do NOT add a
  `web.xml` mapping for a class that already has a `@WebServlet`/`@WebFilter`
  annotation — Tomcat will crash on startup and the whole app 404s.
- **Context path:** `cargo-maven3-plugin` deploys at the root context
  (`<context>/</context>`), so the app is at `http://localhost:8080/`, not
  `http://localhost:8080/mathify-lite/`. Account for this when pinging URLs.
- **Static asset caching:** browsers aggressively cache `.js`/`.css`. If an
  endpoint works but the UI looks stale, suspect a cached asset before
  assuming the backend is broken. Append a cache-busting query param (e.g.
  `app.js?v=2`) whenever you update a static asset.
- **Loading screens for forward navigation:** for forward-moving transitions
  (successful login, going to the dashboard, loading catalog items, etc.) use
  `com.mathify.util.NavigationUtil.redirectWithLoading(req, resp, url, message)`
  instead of `response.sendRedirect()`. Reserve plain `sendRedirect()` for
  validation errors (missing fields, wrong password) where the user expects
  an instant flash back to the form they just submitted.
- DAO methods throw `SQLException`; servlets catch it, log via
  `getServletContext().log(...)`, and redirect with an `?error=...` query param
  that the target JSP reads client-side to show an alert banner.
- `target/` is build output — never edit files there; edit `src/`.
- **DB config:** never commit real credentials to `src/main/resources/db.properties`
  — see README.md's "Configure the connection" step for local defaults.

## Database and schema gotchas

DAO queries assume columns that were not always present in `database/mathify_schema.sql`.
A missing column surfaces as a `?error=server_error` redirect on login or register: the DAO throws `SQLSyntaxErrorException` and the servlet catches it.
A known case is `users.is_disabled BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`, used by the admin "disable student" feature.
When you add a column in a DAO, add it to `database/mathify_schema.sql` and a `database/migration_*.sql` as well.
XAMPP ships its own Tomcat on port 8080; if `cargo:run` reports "Port 8080 in use", stop XAMPP's Tomcat (only MySQL is needed from XAMPP).

## Payments (Midtrans)

The "Go Premium" upgrade uses the Midtrans Snap flow, sandbox by default.
Credentials come from a gitignored `.env` at the project root, read by `com.mathify.util.MidtransConfig` (`MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY`, `MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY`, `MIDTRANS_MERCHANT_ID`, `MIDTRANS_IS_PRODUCTION`, `MIDTRANS_PREMIUM_PRICE`); OS env vars override the file.
Never hard-code keys; see `.env.example`.
The server is the source of truth: `PremiumCheckoutServlet` (`/student/premium/checkout.do`) creates the Snap token with a server-side fixed amount, and `PremiumConfirmServlet` (`/student/premium/confirm.do`) re-verifies the transaction status with Midtrans before granting premium.
Never trust the browser's success callback or a client-supplied amount.
The HTTP calls live in `com.mathify.service.MidtransService` (Basic auth = `Base64(serverKey + ":")`).
There are two plans, selected via the `plan` request parameter: monthly (Rp 125.500, 30 days) and yearly (Rp 1.224.500, 365 days).
No webhook is needed on localhost: activation happens in `confirm.do` via a status check; for production, also configure a Midtrans notification URL.
Premium is persisted by `com.mathify.dao.SubscriptionDAO` into the `subscriptions` table; tracking columns `midtrans_order_id` and `payment_status` were added (see `database/migration_add_payment_tracking.sql`).
Admins can manually grant or revoke premium from the Students page via the `grant_premium` and `revoke_premium` actions, as an override.
The navbar premium badge, energy, and XP come from `GET /student/profile.do` (`StudentProfileServlet`), fetched by `app.js`; JSON is built and parsed with `org.json` (in `pom.xml`).
For testing, the quickest path is card `4811 1111 1111 1114`, CVV `123`, OTP `112233`.
